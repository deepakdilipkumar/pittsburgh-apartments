I've found a very spacious 2BR/1BA apartment at Squirrel Hill and I'm in search for a roommate. If you accept this, you will be sharing the apartment with me. I'll try and list out everything I could possibly think of about the Apartment, owner and me.

Location: 5712 Phillips Ave, Squirrel Hill,  ~ 1.6 miles from CMU, Shuttle bus stops right in front of the building. Commute time by bus is 7 minutes. Also, I will be having a personal car with a license, and would love to plan a carpool.

Safety : Ultra-safe, in general Squirrel is the safest. In particular, this is a family-centric location, with a old-age nursing home bang opposite the street. Apartments are mostly occupied by Graduate students from CMU or sometimes medical students from UPitt. Crime is literally non-existent. You can check the crime index online.

Apartment Layout -  Please check pictures and layout here : http://www.flatquest.com/5712-phillips-avenue-b4/

In a gist: Very Spacious(~ 600 Sqft excluding patio)
* Two equally sized rooms separated by a long corridor
* Fully furnished, new fridge, double oven, and dishwasher provided
* Apartment has washing machine and dryer in the basement itself
* Basement provides a huge cubby for your storage
* New Laminated hardwood floors and ceiling fans
* Per room heat and AC, lots of natural light
* Spacious Bathtub and shower area
* Public patio available


Neighborhood & Feel: Extremely quite location with a suburban feel yet the street corner merges with the much happening Forbes Ave and nearby Murray Ave. A chain of multi-cusine restaurants, grocery stories, coffee shops, libraries and everything you else you need less than 2 minutes of walk away.

Food & Places of Interest: As mentioned earlier, Forbes and Murray Ave has a series of restaurants and places of interest, 2 or 5 minutes away by walk. Some of them I list here:

1) Indian Restaurants - Coriander Grill, Curry on Murray (vegan) 
2) Chinese Restaurants - Ka Mei, Sushi and Dumpling Place (I personally love Chinese food!)
3) Lots of Pizza places, Vietnamese, Italian, Bakery Shops, coffee shops within a 5 minute walk
4) 5 minute walk to a Giant Eagle Supermarket for groceries and your amenities
5) Jerry's Record Store and Acoustics (I'm a music lover!)
6) Carnegie Library of Squirrel Hill is a 8 minutes walk away
7) Davis Playground - Open to public, 2 minutes away

About the owner - Mr.Aaron, a CMU alumni, whom I found to be very helpful and quick to reply. Please check out the testimonials for the apartments and his service here. I've made numerous calls on phone and Skype as well. I've seen the apartments personally on Skype and also asked one of my senior in CMU to visit.

About me - https://www.facebook.com/raghu.tjm
I'm 21 and I'll be moving in by the first week of August, 2016. I like to keep work and living areas clean and organised. Although I'm clean, I'm never extreme. You might get the idea with these few things -  I'd like to keep bathroom neat and dry after showers. I do not throw wet towels, clothes, and other personal items around the house. I eat healthy, workout a little. I can cook a little and happily do a lot of household chores (I feel that they are great stress busters! ). I'd like to share the work with you as you please. 

I listen to loud music (classic rock, alternate rock, metal), but only on my headphones.  I can be fun, entertaining, liberal,  friendly and very accepting (no restrictions!) and I expect the same from my future flatmate. I do eat meat, but its not a necessity for me (I love green food the most). I do not mind keeping separate vessels if you're a vegan. Lastly I highly respect your views.

So please let me know if you're interested. I can take care of the interaction with the owner and application details for the lease for now and give you a little time make a firm decision. After that,  I will quickly explain the paperwork process (It's not a big deal!), so that there is no confusion and complete transparency.",-79.9239265,40.4319132,2.815,33.45
